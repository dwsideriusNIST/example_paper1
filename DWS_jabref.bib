  Abstract                 = {MCM-48 silica was synthesized using GEMINI surfactant and its pore size was enlarged via a post-synthesis procedure in the presence of dimethyldecylamine (DMDA) as swelling agent. The effects of the amount of DMDA as well as the post-synthesis temperature on the pore size of the MCM-48 material were investigated. It was found that pore sizes up to 11.2 nm could be obtained. Generally, the pore size distributions were reasonably narrow and the pore volumes quite high (up to 2.6 cm3/g). The present work demonstrated the possibility to tailor the pore sizes of the MCM-48 silica.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract We report grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations for a {Lennard-Jones} {(LJ)} fluid modeled on methane confined in nanospace with jungle-gym-like {(JG)} cubic structure, which is typically found in porous coordination polymers. Pillars composing the cubic structure were modeled as structureless smooth solid rods made of {LJ} carbon. We examined the effects of pore size, pore geometry, rod thickness, and rod potential onto the condensation phenomena in the {JG} pore structure. The simulations clarified that the condensation pressure and adsorption amount in the {JG} structure were influenced by pore size and rod potential, while the transition type was determined by rod thickness. The characteristics of the {JG} structure lie in the sensitivity to the slight changes in pore size, rod thickness, and rod potential owing to the combination of the packing effect of molecules and the superposition effect of rod potentials.},
